# Dine Restaurant Website

A multi-page restaurant website featuring an elegant homepage and interactive reservation system, built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project is a solution to the Dine Restaurant Website challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dine-restaurant-website-yAt7Vvxt7).

## Features

- **Responsive design** - Fully responsive layout optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports with extended support for ultra-wide displays

- **Interactive reservation form** - Complete booking system with real-time validation, custom date/time pickers, and success feedback

- **Smooth navigation** - Client-side routing with React Router, smooth scroll behavior, and automatic scroll-to-top on page transitions

## Key Learnings

- **Component Architecture & Reusability** - Structured React components with proper prop destructuring, separated data from presentation logic, and created flexible utility functions like `getResponsiveImages()` that adapt to different asset naming patterns.

- **Responsive Image Implementation** - Implemented responsive images using `<picture>` elements with `srcSet` for multiple screen sizes and pixel densities, understanding Vite's asset processing and creating helper functions for efficient image management.

- **Project Structure Best Practices** - Established scalable file organization with separated data files, utility functions, and components, making informed decisions about when to use props vs hardcoded values while maintaining component integrity and reusability

- **Form handling with custom validation** - building real-time validation with error states, custom components, and user feedback patterns

- **React Router with deployment configuration** - implementing client-side routing with scroll management and basename configuration for GitHub Pages
